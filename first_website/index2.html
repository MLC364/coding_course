	<p>Hi! I'm Megan, welcome to my blog.</p>

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a second year student studying Psychology at the University of Southampton. I have just recently begun learning to code and this is my page to demonstrate that. Take a look around and let me know what you think!</p>
	<h1>Passions</h1>
	<h4>Technology</h4>
	<p>I LOVE technology. Ever since I can remember, I have been interested in the 'next best thing'- I am notorious for getting a new phone each year. I just get too excited when new ones are released. So much so that I literally spend hours watching unboxing videos on YouTube. And it doesn't stop at phones. My Brother always takes the mick out of me because I have so many different tech things.</p>
	<h4>'Gyming'</h4>
	<p>Yes, I get it. You're probably bored of all these people that are now on th gym hype. I promise you I'm not one of those people. I GENUINELY enjoy it. What's more, I don't just spend half an hour on a treadmill; I actually spend time in the weights section. Infact, the only cardio I do is 4 minutes of tabata at the beginning of my session. Cardio is my enemy. I'm onto the rack as soon as I can. I don't know what it is about the gym that just makes it so irresistable to me. I guess now that I am over the initial period of training with no results, I just find it exciting. You get to shape your body how you want it. And the burn the morning after- that makes all the effort worth while. Aside from aesthetics, just being stronger feels great. So much so that I managed to squat my 13 stone friend.</p>
	<h4>Learning!</h4>
	<p>Our brains have this infinite capacity to take on information and I can't tell you how much that excites me (yes, a psychology reference). We can learn sooo much information and being at uni is the best place for it. We have access to an almost infinite amount of information- especially now that the internet is at our finger tips. Actually, my most favourite way to learn is by talking people. You can learn so much when someone speaks passionately about something that interests them or something that they have experienced. I'm currently learning Spanish. It isn't as much of a random thing as it sounds; I studied Spanish at GCSE so I was keen to pick it up again. Turn's out, 1) it doesnt take long to forget a language and 2) it is easier to learn the second time!</p>
	<h4>Psychology</h4>
	<p>Where to start with psychology?! It's great. Most people think of it as such a weak subject and I get it, it does come across as a bit wishy-washy but that's the beauty of it- it is an amalgamation of different people's theories and ideas and you get to learn their different perspectives. I mean it is a bit weird experiencing your life unfolding before your eyes as these theories explain why you are the way you are. But again, that is what makes it interesting. There is an interesting idea that those who study psychology do it because they want to undestand themselves. It's like paying for a degree and three years of psychoanalysis!</p>

	<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>So I thought I would add this in just to fill some space. Feel free to ignore it. I did 11 GCSE's and got 11 A*-B's aswell as three A-levels in which I got AAB.</p>
